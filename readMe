The script takes "img.jpg" and "logo.png" as input.

It has been implemented and testing using the versions below:

OpenCV -- 3.2.0-dev
Python -- 3.5.2
Ubuntu -- 16.04

The code works without any error in my settings. And it should work in any other images.

In case of any problem, you can contact me.
